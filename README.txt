ELITE ON-DEVICE Macro Tracker (Home Screen App)
=================================================
No external APIs. Auto-macros works from your on-device Food Library.

How auto-macros works:
1) First time: type the food name, enter macros once (from label), tap "Save as Food".
2) Next time: just type the name (or scan barcode) and macros auto-fill.
